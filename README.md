Project Overview
In this project, I developed a smart pirate character for a treasure hunt game. The pirate needs to find the treasure before the human player does. The challenge was to create an algorithm that helps the pirate figure out the best path through various obstacles to reach the treasure.

Work Done
Provided Code:
Starter Code: Included basic functions for moving the pirate around a grid-like game world.
Sample Environment: A map with pathways, obstacles, and a treasure.
Developed Code:
Deep Q-Learning Algorithm: I created an algorithm that helps the pirate learn the best path to the treasure by trial and error.
State and Actions: The pirate's position and surroundings were used to make decisions, and it could move in four directions (up, down, left, right).
Training: The pirate learned by getting rewards for moving closer to the treasure and penalties for hitting obstacles.
Performance Evaluation: I checked how quickly and efficiently the pirate could find the treasure over multiple training sessions.
AI Concepts and Design Defense
AI Learning:

Reinforcement Learning: The pirate learned through rewards and penalties.
Deep Q-Learning: Combined traditional learning methods with a neural network to handle complex decisions.
Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balanced between trying new paths and using the best-known paths.
Ethical Considerations:

Fair Play: Ensured the pirate behaves fairly and transparently, providing a fun challenge for players.
Reflection
Role of AI Developers:

AI developers solve problems by designing smart systems. This project showed how AI can make games more engaging.
Problem-Solving Approach:

I approached the problem step-by-step, improving the pirateâ€™s strategy based on performance feedback.
Ethical Responsibilities:

I focused on creating a fair and enjoyable game experience, ensuring the pirate's actions were predictable and transparent.
